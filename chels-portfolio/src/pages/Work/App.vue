      <h3>100 Days, Racism, and Starting Over</h3>
      <p>What happens when a junior dev stops coding for 3 months? 
        What really matters is what happens after the tech reprieve. Learn about how unplugging from technology allowed me to grow immensely, and how I regained my faith in programming by completing a coding challenge. 
        Tech Talk given at Minnebar in April 2019. </p>

      <h3>Shit Black Parents Say Lorem Ipsum</h3>
      <p>A lorem ipsum generator I made as an homage to Black Parents sayings. 
        Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.
        The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) 
        This project was made using HTML5, CSS3, and ExpressJS. </p>

      <h3>My Love Of Semicolons</h3>
      <p>Last summer, I worked as an intern for a company called Software for Good.  
        During my internship, I got the opportunity to write the "Theme Of The Week".This is when an employee from Software For Good takes time to write whats on their mind. 
        For me, I wrote about my love of semicolons, and how programming has made me enjoy semicolons more.</p>
